               <!--             Talking about the table-->
               The school calendar design required a bit of work. I needed to use some CSS in a linked sheet while other parts of it were included internally with the table tags. It's great that I get to explore my options in terms of how I can go about formatting a web page. I explored a lot of different tags and use of css styles and incorporated some of that into the overall design. This exercise  allowed me to look at how versatile an html table can be, including inserting images into cells, or inserting links into each cell. One concept I found interesting is that like sections in a webpage like the body and the head, tables use a similar concept. thead allowed for me to group all the headers so I can format all the headers at once. All in all, there are lots of new concepts and they all work together to make a web page look great.
