<!--
1. Research electronic portfolios more - create an HTML5 page (named portfolios.html) discussing the importance of
a portfolio as it relates to your intended career. 
Also discuss on the page what your individual portfolio should include to get you a job in your intended career.
Include links to the sites where you conducted your research 
(minimum 2 not including the one’s provided on this page above). 
Use many of the HTML5 tags we have learned in this course to make the page look professional. 
The portfolio.html page does not count towards the number of pages required for the final project and must not be included in the navigation of the site.

                <strong>Portfolios</strong> are crucial for anyone who wishes to learn more because they allow a user to keep track of what they've learned.
                In addition, portfolios show the user's accomplishments via blogs, multimedia, hyperlinks, etc. Portfolio's are
                essentially interactive learning tools that are designed in a way that it allows other users to provide feedback
                and comments to the original poster's learning experience.

                <!--             Talking about how portfolios are related to careers -->
                In one's careers, portfolios are a wonderful way to record all of one's findings. For example, an <strong> IT system support specialist </strong> would record all of his/her findings in the portfolio. This would include all of the problems encountered, all the solutions, work arounds, thought processes, etc.
                As a result, the portfolio would demonstrate a <em>journey</em> through one's experiences and overall learned lessons. From there, other users can comment and add their input which could include possible solutions or feedback.

                In my particular example, my preferred career is in <strong> databases and reporting </strong> which is located in IT. Similarly to the system support specialist, I would use a portfolio to record all of my problems, and solutions, along with anything that I may find useful to the specific task at hand.
                I may record in my portfolio something such as <em>"Today, I have been asked by my coworker what the best way is to find all customers located in the Florida. I was able to explain that the best way to do that was to query the X database on the X server."</em> this poses a problem and a solution to the reader.
                This could help anyone who has had a similar problem as the coworker in the example. Portfolios can work wonders for your career, as they show that you <strong>consistently learning</strong> and <strong>trying new things</strong>. Employers who view a portfolio can easily see the hard work and accomplishments via the portfolio option.
