My experience with building this website was actually a lot of fun. There was a bit of a learning curve with some of the techniques I was trying to do, such as the top navigation bar, but overall I did learn alot. I now know much better than before about how to create an appealing website. Part of this was due to all the research I had done on portfolios. I went for a somewhat modern look, but I didn't want to go too overboard. The hardest part for me was to create that navigation at the top. With a lot of research and consistent dedication, I was able to pull it off. All of my pages validate no problem and I think the content in the pages say a lot for a portfolio. 

I can see myself applying what I learned in this project to some of the things that I do at work, or maybe even in the future if I wish I can use this website as a template for a resume. Either way, I have plenty of opportunity now that I have much more confidence in my web coding.
