            <br> <br> Technology for me has been my passion since I was ten years old and started with an old HP computer that by today's standards would be considered a <em>dinosaur</em>. Ever since, I have taught myself how to troubleshoot and diagnose computer hardware and software issues efficiently. I have built many computers for my family, friends, and of course myself.
            <br><br> Many years later, I began learning about the expanse world of databases via an internship at Bankers Healthcare Group (BHG). From there I gained experience and knowledge in <strong>SQL Server, the SQL language, and reporting &amp; integration services</strong>. After months of hard work, I was accepted as a full time employee and have been working at BHG for over two years now.
            <br><br> Technology never stops expanding, which is why keeping up on the latest trends is absolutely crucial.
