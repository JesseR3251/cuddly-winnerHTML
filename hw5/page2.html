                Image maps can prove to be quite useful for plenty of different reasons. Primarily it is used to identify multiple elements in an image. This can be the case in my example, where the duck can be identified by hovering over it with the mouse. Another example of image maps are for photographs with groups of people. Instead of saying "From left to right, John, Alex.. etc" one can use an image map. The image map can even take the user to another website when one clicks on the person.

                While it does have many uses, I do not see it used to often in the websites I frequently visit. I think image maps can make a comeback if the image and css make it more interactive and entertaining to click on the different elements in the image. Other than that, sometimes image maps are not that obvious they are clickable to the user and can often be skipped over entirely. The website design would need to make that very clear.
