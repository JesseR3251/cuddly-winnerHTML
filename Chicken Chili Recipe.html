      <p>
         Follow the following steps to create your perfect chili:
      </p>
      <!-- Ordered List -->
      <ol type="A">
         <li>
            Prepare your ingredients: have your vegetables chopping into smaller sizes, prepare beans, etc.
         </li>
         <li>
            Throw all your ingredients into your slow cooker of choice, including the seasoning.
         </li>
         <li>
            Fill the slow cooker with water till the water reaches the top of the ingredients
         </li>
         <li>
            Turn the slow cooker on high and leave for around four or five hours, the longer you cook it, the more tender the chicken will be!
         </li>
         <li>
            Chicken and vegetables should be tender, if they're still tough let the ingredients cook longer.
         </li>
      </ol>

         This is a wonderful recipe! <br> After making it at least five times I can say for sure that this is my all time favorite chili recipe! <br>
         My family loves this and it's easy to cook. My crockpot really does all the hardwork here as <br> it lets all the seasonings and flavors soak in overnight! Again, this is great for anyone looking <br> for an easy to make dinner recipe!
