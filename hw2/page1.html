            What Is A Paradigm Shift?
         </h2>
         <p>
            A <em>paradigm shift</em> is a change from one way of thinking to another. In the world of Information Technology, it is not uncommon to have many paradigm shifts. For example, the way information is obtained now and 20 years ago is drastically different. Internet speed and connectivity have improved since the dial up days. As a result, websites themselves have changed allowing users to interact with websites in many ways. Facebook, Youtube, and Linkedin are a few popular examples were users can <em>crowd source</em>, or having a large number of people input information via the internet. Paradigm shifts not only involve a new way of thinking, but it also means adapting to the newest, and most advanced technologies.

            Moore's Law
         </h2>
         <p>
            <em>Moore's Law </em> is an analogy for advances in technological innovation. The analogy said by Intel's co-founder <em>Gordon Moore</em> in 1965 said "the number of transistors per square inch on integrated circuits had doubled every year since their invention" and since then his trend remained mostly consistent. The main takeaway from what Gordon had said back in the 60s is that certain predications must be made about the advancements in technology to make constant improvements and breakthroughs. Moore's law can be applied to many concepts and ideas within the <strong> computer sciences</strong> .
