            <strong>DNS</strong> or <em> Domain Name Server</em> can be thought of as the internet's phone book. In a phone book, one would associate a person's name with a phone number; similarly, with DNS it is an IP address associated with a website name. DNS is especially helpful because otherwise users would need to input an IP address instead of a familiar name such as Google.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Virtual Domains</strong> can be thought of an extension of the domain name system. With a virtual domain system, one can have multiple domain names on a single server. This has numerous benefits including centralizing all resources to one web server.

            <br>
            <Strong> Shared hosting</Strong> is a type of web hosting where the internet service provider hosts all of one's web sites with each having its own internet domain name from one server. Shared hosting is used a lot because it is a cheap alternative for starting businesses with less traffic.

            <br>
            Domain names are stored at a central registry where host companies such as GoDaddy and Internet Service Providers such as ATT interact with. DNS information is updated frequently. Typically, when one registers their IP address for a domain name it takes about 36 hours or less.

            <strong>FQDN</strong> otherwise known as a <em>Fully Qualified Domain Name</em> would be the entire domain name for a host. In this example, "SomeServer.SomeWebsite.com" SomeServer is the hostname, SomeWebsite is the domain name, and the .com is the top level domain. Very rarely will a user see the host name. When visiting google.com there is much uncertainty what the hostname really is. Websites that are not fully qualified are known as <em>Partially qualified domain names</em>.
