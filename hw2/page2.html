            Popular Protocols in Information Technology
         </h2>
         <p>
            <strong>PPP</strong> or <em>Point to Point Protocol</em> is a computer network protocol to transport multiprotocol data over point-to-point links. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>PPoE</strong> or <em>Point to Point over Ethernet</em> uses PPP, and runs over broadband connections, using an ethernet link layer protocol allowing the user to connect to hosts over bridges and concentrators.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong> HTTP</strong> or <em>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</em> allows computers all over the world to communicate via the <em>World Wide Web</em>. It provides a definition for how pages are formatted and transmitted and how servers and browsers handles various responses and commands.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong> FTP</strong> or <em>File Transfer Protocol</em> is what is primarily used to transfer files over the web. FTP works off the TCP/IP protocols to achieve this.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>SMTP</strong> or <em>Simple Mail Transfer Protocol</em> uses the TCP/IP protocol to send and receive emails. It is somewhat limited in receiving mail, so it is usually used as a sending protocol and one of the other two, POP3, or IMAP is used as receiving instead.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>IMAP</strong> or <em>Internet Message Access Protocol</em> is another standard email protocol. It allows the user to perform their everyday actions from a web server. Generally, IMAP is thought as a remote file server while POP3 is the opposite.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>POP3</strong> or <em>Post Office Protocol</em> is an email protocol used to retrieve email from a remove server over TCP/IP connection. POP3 is starting to lose its popularity to IMAP due to its more advanced features.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>NNTP</strong> or <em>Network News Transfer Protocol</em> is used by computers and servers for managing the notes posted on UseNet newgroups. NNTP servers run the global network of collected Usenet newgroups and include the server at your internet access provider.
