                Forms are a keypart of just about every website. Forms can be used to login, submit, request, and upload information. <br>
                In page 2, I use the form tag to prompt the user to enter their name, email, username, password, and more. <br>
                When using a form, one must make sure they use a script as well in order to send the user's information somewhere. <br>
                Page 2 uses a script that came attached with the CIW book, and once the user submits their information, it is displayed to them after they submit.
                Like with many tags, the form tag can also be formatted with CSS. I do some formatting to the forms in page 2 for demonstration purposes.
                Please see page 2 for more information.
