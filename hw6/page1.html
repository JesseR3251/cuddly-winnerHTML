<!--
For this assignment you will create an image map using an appropriate image you created or found online (taking intellectual property rights into account). The image must contain a minimum of 3 different shapes that fit parts of the image in that shape. Create a home page and 1 additional page (in folder hw5) showing an image map with shape links that work correctly and each links to a webpage that is related in some way to the shape (makes sense at least). The image map page must contain at least 1 paragraph discussing image maps and their place in current web pages – do you like them when you visit a page? Are they popular? Are they user friendly, etc…?

            HTML and CSS are great tools to create websites; however, bringing a website to it's next level involves using Javascript in order to add additional functionality, or create a website that stands out from the rest by using changing colored text over mouse hover.
